**Invoice Distribution** is The accounting information for an invoice line, such as accounting date, amount, and account combination.

For example, we can create a distribution set that allocates the advertising expense on an invoice to four advertising departments. We can add the distribution set to a supplier site assignment to use the set on every invoice for that supplier site and business unit.
