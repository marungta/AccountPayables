**Payment terms** is what your suppliers offer you when they invoice/bill you. They are usually negotiated upfront

Payment term usually contains when your invoice is due and discount if any, you get if you pay your suppliers before due date.

For example, say a payment term Net 30, would mean invoice is due , 30 days after  invoice date.
2/10 net 30, would mean payment is due in 30 days, But if paid within 2 days, 10% discount can be availed.
